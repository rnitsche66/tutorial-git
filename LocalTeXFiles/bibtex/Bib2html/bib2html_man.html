<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG> converts a bibtex-format bibliography file to HTML.
     <EM>sourcefile</EM> may be either a BibTeX-format bibliography (<STRONG>.bib</STRONG>)
     file or a LaTeX-format (<STRONG>.aux</STRONG>) file.

     Since the HTML-formatted bibliography  will  often  be  just
     part  of a larger HTML file, <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG> attempts to update the
     HTML file in place.  It does this by searching <EM>htmlfile</EM>  for
     two  special strings, which delimit the bibliography part of
     the file.  These strings are the HTML comments

          &lt;!-- BEGIN BIBLIOGRAPHY <EM>delimiter</EM> --&gt;

          &lt;!-- END BIBLIOGRAPHY <EM>delimiter</EM> --&gt;

     If these delimiters are found, the old bibliography  between
     them  is  replaced with the new bibliography.  Otherwise the
     new  bibliography,  with  the  appropriate  delimiters,   is
     appended to the end of <EM>htmlfile</EM>, and it will be necessary to
     move it to the proper location by hand.   Note  that  it  is
     possible  for  <EM>htmlfile</EM>  to contain any number of bibliogra-
     phies,  and  they  may  be  updated  independently.   If  no
     <EM>htmlfile</EM>  is specified, the bibliography is written to stan-
     dard output.

     The tag of each BibTeX bibliography entry is converted  into
     a  name anchor (&lt;A NAME="tag"&gt;) in <EM>htmlfile</EM>, and may be used
     to construct a link to this particular entry.

  <STRONG>Special</STRONG> <STRONG>Field</STRONG> <STRONG>Processing</STRONG>
     Several BibTeX fields are treated specially.  The  filenames
     specified  in  the <STRONG>postscript</STRONG>, <STRONG>pdf</STRONG>, and <STRONG>dvi</STRONG> fields are rela-
     tive to  the  <EM>htmlfile</EM>  directory.   In  addition,  <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG>
     recognizes compressed or gzipped files (those with filenames
     ending in <STRONG>.Z</STRONG>, <STRONG>.gz</STRONG>, or <STRONG>.z</STRONG>).

     <STRONG>url</STRONG>  If the <STRONG>url</STRONG> field exists, a link (``A'' tag) is created.
          The  destination  of  the  link is the <STRONG>url</STRONG> tag's value.
          The bibliography entry's title is  the  source  of  the
          link.  This can be used to create a link to a HTML ver-
          sion of the paper, or to a version that is available by
          ftp.

     <STRONG>postscript</STRONG>
          If the <STRONG>postscript</STRONG> field exists, its value  is  used  as
          the name of a PostScript file.  <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG> creates a link
          to the file.  , and updates <EM>htmlfile</EM> with the number of
          pages and size of the PostScript file.

     <STRONG>pdf</STRONG>  If the <STRONG>pdf</STRONG> field exists, its value is used as the  name
          of  a  PDF  (portable  document format) file.  <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG>
          creates a link to the file and  updates  <EM>htmlfile</EM>  with
          the size of the PDF file.

     <STRONG>dvi</STRONG>  If the <STRONG>dvi</STRONG> field exists, its value is used as the  name
          of a TeX DVI file.  <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG> creates a link to the file
          and updates <EM>htmlfile</EM> with the number of pages and  size
          of the DVI file.

     <STRONG>author</STRONG>, <STRONG>keywords</STRONG>
          The full <STRONG>author</STRONG> and  <STRONG>keywords</STRONG>  fields  of  each  BibTeX
          entry  are  included  in <EM>htmlfile</EM> as HTML comments, and
          may be used by CGI scripts (such as <STRONG>bibsearch</STRONG>, which is
          supplied) to select only certain entries.

  <STRONG>Hints</STRONG>
     <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG>'s LaTeX to HTML conversion is not very  smart.   If
     something isn't being converted correctly, try doing it in a
     different way.

     <STRONG>bib2html</STRONG> does not currently  understand  \<EM>verb</EM>.   To  get  a
     tilde into a filename or URL, use \~{}.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <STRONG>-a</STRONG>    Include  the  BibTeX  file's  abstract  field  in  the
          bibliography.

     <STRONG>-c</STRONG>    Sort chronologically.  Normally, the  bibliography  is
          ordered  first  by  author and then by year.  With this
          option, the bibliography is ordered by  year  and  then
          author.

     <STRONG>-d</STRONG> <EM>delimiter</EM>
          Specify the delimiter that sets  the  bibliography  off
          from  the rest of the HTML file.  The default delimiter
          is the name of the  bibliography  file  with  the  <STRONG>.bib</STRONG>
          extension stripped.

     <STRONG>-h</STRONG> <EM>heading</EM>
          Use the string <EM>heading</EM> instead  of  the  default  title
          when  creating a new <EM>htmlfile</EM>.  If updating an existing
          <EM>htmlfile</EM>, this option is ignored.

     <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   Reverse the chronological sorting order.  Normally, the
          bibliography  is  sorted from the earliest entry to the
          latest entry.  With this option, the order is reversed.

     <STRONG>-s</STRONG> <EM>style</EM>
          Create a <EM>style</EM>-style  bibliography.   Supported  styles
          are  <STRONG>empty</STRONG>  (the  default),  <STRONG>plain</STRONG>,  <STRONG>unsort</STRONG>, <STRONG>alpha</STRONG>, and
          <STRONG>named</STRONG>.  An <STRONG>empty</STRONG> bibliography is a  bulleted  list.   A
          <STRONG>plain</STRONG>  bibliography is a numbered list.  <STRONG>unsort</STRONG> is like
          <STRONG>plain</STRONG> except that the entries in the HTML file  are  in
          the  same  order as as they are in the source file.  An
          <STRONG>alpha</STRONG> bibliography has labels that are  in  the  BibTeX
          alpha  style.   A  <STRONG>named</STRONG> bibliography has labels of the
          form [name, year].

     <STRONG>-t</STRONG>    Write a timestamp with the date at which the  bibliog-
          raphy was updated to <EM>htmlfile</EM>.

     <STRONG>-v</STRONG>    Report version number on stderr.

     <STRONG>-3</STRONG>    Perform some HTML 3.0 mappings.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     The LaTeX to HTML translation, while decent, is not perfect.

     Requires bibtex and perl.  However, I think that most  sites
     that  would want to convert BibTeX to HTML will already have
     both programs installed.

     Relies on dviselect to count the number of pages  in  a  DVI
     file.
